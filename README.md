## Project Aim
This project aims to demonstrate a microservices architecture for a video-to-MP3 converter service using Python. It provides a scalable and maintainable way to convert video files to MP3 format, showcasing best practices in modern software development.

## What It Does
- **Video-to-MP3 Conversion**: Converts video files to MP3 format.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Implements a microservices architecture using Python, allowing for scalable and maintainable development.
- **Service Communication**: Utilizes RabbitMQ for inter-service communication, enabling asynchronous message passing between services.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: Manages and scales the microservices using Kubernetes.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **FastAPI**: A fast, modern web framework for building APIs.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker used for inter-service communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration tool for managing and scaling containers.
